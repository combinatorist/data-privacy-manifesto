# data-privacy-manifesto
Ideas to balance individual privacy with Big Data and AI through awareness, law, alternatives, and best practices.

# About
An initial group of 9+ software developers and attorneys met and discussed these issues and brainstormed possible solutions at the 2018 Music City Legal Hackathon.

# Public Participants
- Koren Boyd
- Cristian Orozco
- Tim Eccleston

# Inspiration
We considered the situation with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and asked the question:

> How do we use big data to solve problems and create public good* while still protecting individual privacy?

*For example, human genome, or more efficient social services, etc.

# Observations
- AI offers opportunities for improved operational efficiencies.
- However, to address the most interesting personal and public problems, AI requires lots of personal and sensitive data.
- This is usually at odds with the interest of individuals to keep their data private.

# Issues in Tension
- balancing individual against opportunities for AI solutions with big data
- profit vs. public good

# Concepts
- interoperability
- user-controled data
- technical solutions are preferable to (but supported by) litigation
- create and use open source protocols to allow users to port and interoperate  their own data (e.g. user easily carries their data from one hospital to another)
- better, simpler Terms of Service
- limitations of data use
- extremely targeted advertising targets individuals, not just demographics (this is categorically different)

# Purpose
We need to develop technology that raises public awareness about data use by AI and puts control of Data in the hands of the individual. 

# Threats
- Targeted fake news
- enables discrimination
- bad data leading to bad policy and harmful interactions
- mishandling of data (hacks)
- irreversibility of data leaks (not resolved by litigation)

# Domains for solving this problem:
- private individual awareness of data / privacy issues
- technological alternatives that respect privacy (and provide granular privacy options)
- progressive regulation that enforces Terms of Service and data use 
  - universal constraints
  - something to incentivize reasonable, understandable terms of Service
  - required disclaimers for key controversial uses of data (e.g. "YOUR DATA CAN BE USED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU IN ADS SUCH AS HOUSING, JOBS, AND LOANS")
- use technology / AI against bad (AI / data) actors
  - detect discrimination or unauthorized use of data (with AI)
  - use AI to summarize Terms of Service for users
  - use AI to detect inaccurate or misidentified data (people blamed for others' choices)
  - use (distributed) technology to help people control their own data (technical guarantee as alternative to litigation)
